# C Minor

C Minor follows largely C-style syntax; it borrows elements from many other languages such as Fortran 90, Ada, LISP, Java, and Pascal. The main paradigms of the language are imperative and object-oriented. The simplified syntax of C Minor may serve as a stepping stone to other C style languages for novice programmers while avoiding overly complex constructs they have no need of.
