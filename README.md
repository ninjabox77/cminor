# C-Minor

C-Minor is a pedagogical language that has been proposed at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) to facilitate the learning of programming languages for first years college students. It follows largely C-style syntax and borrows elements from many other languages such as Fortran 90, Ada, LISP, Java, and Pascal. The main paradigms of the language are imperative and object-oriented. The simplified syntax of C-Minor may serve as a stepping stone to other C style languages for novice programmers while avoiding overly complex constructs they have no need of.

The work will be focused largely on faithfully building a compiler and a virtual machine for the language. An example of a `hello world!` program written in C-Minor is depited below:

```c++
main {
  out "hello world!"
}
```

<b>Note</b>: There is a good possibility that you will encounter compile problems or miscompilations if you attempt to compile a program other than the compiler itself. This is basically a one-man project, and I have spent only a few months of my spare time so far.
