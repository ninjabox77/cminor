# C-Minor

C-Minor is a pedagogical language that has been proposed at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) to facilitate the learning of programming languages for first years college students. It follows largely C-style syntax and borrows elements from many other languages such as Fortran 90, Ada, LISP, Java, and Pascal. The main paradigms of the language are imperative and object-oriented. The simplified syntax of C-Minor may serve as a stepping stone to other C style languages for novice programmers while avoiding overly complex constructs they have no need of.

The work done thus far has focused largely on faithfully recreating the semantics of C-Minor in the parser.
